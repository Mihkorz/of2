        <p><b>The BioChem database</b> maps biological signaling pathways to the genes and nodes that they
affect. Each gene in the pathway is distinguished by whether it has a <i>positive/activator</i> or
<i>negative/repressor</i> role on the activation of other genes and nodes.</p>
<p> Since many diseases are
the result of network interactions among multiple regulatory genes, these signaling pathways
provide important insight about which genetic factors contribute to health effects.</p>
<p> OncoFinder
allows you to quantitatively measure the differences in signaling pathway activation between
different groups to determine which biological pathways are affected by disease. Pathways
are available for cell signaling and metabolism in humans, as well as mouse signaling
pathways.</p>

        <p>OncoFinder simplifies your data management. Instead of having files scattered around your
computer for different projects, OncoFinder gives you a workspace that allows you to create
individual projects where you can store multiple related datasets in one place.</p>
<p> Once you upload your documents to the website, you can view them at any time in spreadsheet format.
Performing calculations is as simple as uploading files, and the results of the calculations are
stored as well.</p>
<p>You also have the ability to see projects created by other users. If you wish to
share a project with other users then you may create a public project, otherwise to make it so
that only you can view it you may create a private project.</p>

        <p>OncoFinder allows you to analyze the effect of drugs at the molecular level by mapping
drugs to their target genes.</p>
<p>You also have the ability to see which signaling pathways are
affected by drugs. Drugs are categorized based on whether they have an <i>activator, inhibitor,
or multivalent</i> effect on genes to determine the effects of drugs on signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Using calculations for signaling pathway activation, OncoFinder allows you to quantitatively
score drugs based on whether or not they can potentially restore normal gene expression in
diseased cells. This makes it possible to recommend drugs to patients on an personalized
basis to improve drug therapy for diseases such as cancer that vary on an indiviudal basis.</p>
